\title{Generate heatmaps for various studies/subgroups of a study.}
\usage{
heatmapOutput(submissionName, shortenStudyNames = TRUE,
  genelimit = "none", resolution = 600, RowCex = 0.8, ColCex = 0.8,
  heatmapMargines = c(15,07), angleForYaxisNames = 45, heatmapColor = "RdBu",
  reverseColor = TRUE, transposedHeatmap = FALSE, simplify = FALSE,
  simplifictionCuttoff = FALSE, genesToDrop = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{submissionName}{a character string containing name of interest. It is
used for naming the process.}

\item{shortenStudyNames}{a logical vector. If the value is set as TRUE,
function will try to remove the last part of the cancer names aiming to
shorten them. The removed segment usually contains the name of scientific
group that has conducted the experiment.}

\item{genelimit}{if large number of genes exist in at least one gene group,
this option can be used to limit the number of genes that are shown on
heatmap. For instance, \code{genelimit=50} will limit the heatmap to 50 genes
that show the most variation across multiple study / study subgroups. The
default value is \code{none}.}

\item{resolution}{a number. This option can be used to adjust the resolution
of the output heatmaps as 'dot per inch'. The defalut value is 600.}

\item{RowCex}{a number that specifies letter size in heatmap row names.}

\item{ColCex}{a number that specifies letter size in heatmap column names.}

\item{heatmapMargines}{a numeric vector that is used to set heatmap margins.
The default value is \code{heatmapMargines=c(15,07)}.}

\item{angleForYaxisNames}{a number that determines the angle with which the
studies/study subgroups names are shown in heatmaps. The default value is 45
degree.}

\item{heatmapColor}{a character string that defines heatmap color. The
default value is "RdBu". "redgreen" is also a popular color in genomic
studies. To see the rest of colors, please type \code{library(RColorBrewer)}
and then \code{display.brewer.all()}.}

\item{reverseColor}{a logical value that reverses the color gradiant for
heatmap(s).}

\item{transposedHeatmap}{a logical value that transposes heatmap rows to
columns and vice versa.}

\item{simplify}{a logical value that tells the function whether or not to
change values under \code{simplifictionCuttoff} to zero. The purpose behind
this option is to facilitate seeing candidate genes. Therefore, it is not
suited for publications.}

\item{simplifictionCuttoff}{a logical value that, if
\code{simplify.visulization = TRUE}, needs to be set as a desired cuttoff for
\code{simplify.visulization}. It has the same unit as \code{cutoff}.}

\item{genesToDrop}{a character vector. Gene names within this vector will be
omitted from heatmap.}
}
\value{
Based on preference, three heatmaps for "Frequency.Percentage",
"Mean.Value" and "Median.value" can be generated. If more than one group of
genes are entered, output for each group will be strored in a separate
sub-directory.
}
\description{
This function can prepare heatmap for 'frequency percentage',
'mean value' and 'median value' data provided by
automatedStatistics() function.
